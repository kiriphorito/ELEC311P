Please find below the instructions for connecting your RPi to Eduroam.

1) Download the file called “eduroam-pi-config” which is attached to this email to your computer. Do NOT change the extension of the file. I repeat....do NOT change the extension of the filename.
2) Copy the file from your computer to a USB stick.
3) Insert the USB stick in one of the USB ports available on your RPi.
4) Open up a terminal on the RPi.
5) Type the following command into the terminal:

ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/

This should list your USB drive which will appear as an SDA device. On my RPi, the USB drive is referred to as “sda1”.

Ensure you make note of both the sda name and the numeric ID (for example, 18A9-9943).

6) Now type the following commands, one-by-one in the following order:

sudo mkdir /media/usb
sudo chown -R pi:pi /media/usb
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /media/usb -o uid=pi,gid=pi

For full details of mounting a USB drive on a RPi, please refer to the tutorial below:
http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2014/05/how-to-mount-a-usb-flash-disk-on-the-raspberry-pi/

7) If you did not get any errors, then the USB drive should be mounted. Type in the following command:

cd /media/usb

This will take you to the contents of the USB drive.

8) Now type in the command:

ls

You should see that the file “eduroam-pi-config” is available.

9) Now type in the command:

chmod 700 eduroam-pi-config

followed by the command:

sudo ./eduroam-pi-config

It will ask for your UCL userid. Enter this with the @ucl.ac.uk. Then it will ask for your password to be entered twice. As long as those passwords match it will write the config file to /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf. 

10) Now restart your RPi.

That’s it! You should now have WiFi connectivity on your RPi through Eduroam.
